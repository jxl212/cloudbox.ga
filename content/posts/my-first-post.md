# Kubernetes

----

Kubernetes is an open source system for managing [containerized applications]
across multiple hosts; providing basic mechanisms for deployment, maintenance,
and scaling of applications.

Kubernetes builds upon a decade and a half of experience at Google running
production workloads at scale using a system called [Borg],
combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.

Kubernetes is hosted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation ([CNCF]).
If you are a company that wants to help shape the evolution of
technologies that are container-packaged, dynamically-scheduled
and microservices-oriented, consider joining the CNCF.
For details about who's involved and how Kubernetes plays a role,
read the CNCF [announcement].

## To start using Kubernetes

See our documentation on [kubernetes.io].

Try our [interactive tutorial].

Take a free course on [Scalable Microservices with Kubernetes].

## To start developing Kubernetes

The [community repository] hosts all information about
building Kubernetes from source, how to contribute code
and documentation, who to contact about what, etc.

If you want to build Kubernetes right away there are two options:

##### You have a working [Go environment].

```
$ go get -d k8s.io/kubernetes
$ cd $GOPATH/src/k8s.io/kubernetes
$ make
```

##### You have a working [Docker environment].

```
$ git clone https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes
$ cd kubernetes
$ make quick-release
```

For the full story, head over to the [developer's documentation].
